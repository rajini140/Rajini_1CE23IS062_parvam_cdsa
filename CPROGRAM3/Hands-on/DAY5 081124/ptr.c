Pointers
    a. Single-linked pointers
    b. Multi-linked pointers
    c. Dangling pointers (is a pointer whose link is removed from the another variable) || Bad programming â†“
    d. Memory Leak (pointer is removed but memory is present and cannot be accessed)
    e. NULL pointer OR Wild Pointer
    f. Constant Pointers
..& refers to address and 8 refers to the value
